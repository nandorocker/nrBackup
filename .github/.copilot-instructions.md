Never use npm, only use pnpm.
When you run a terminal command while another one is running, it will not work. Always read the last few lines on the terminal before running a command. In those cases, open a new terminal window.
Most of the time, your terminal will be on the root directory, so run commands without a `cd` command first. If that fails, then use `cd` to navigate to the correct directory.
